### 🤓 Just an Average Nerd Trying to Stand Out

Welcome to the code vault of someone who definitely googles "how to center a div" more than they'd like to admit.

This repo is a mix of:

* Half-baked ideas
* Over-engineered solutions to simple problems
* And the occasional “wait... it actually works?”

🧪 Built with:

* Pure stubbornness
* Coffee (unmeasured)
* And a healthy disrespect for best practices (just kidding… kinda)

Whether you're here to steal code, judge silently, or accidentally learn something — you’re welcome. Star it if it makes you smile. Fork it if you're brave. Open an issue if you found a bug (or just want to talk about Star Wars).
